# Cliff Android app

More information to come. See <https://github.com/Samasaur1/cliff-server>

## Notes for building

You need a `google-services.json` file in `app/`. I've `.gitignore`d this file, but you should create your own Firebase project, download google-services.json, and put it in this directory. You'll also need to download Firebase credentials for use with the server.
